Overview
We’re building ParkIt, a platform to connect event-goers with nearby residents who can rent out their driveways or yards for affordable parking.

Team name

Idea
Provide a simple web app for users to reserve cheaper, convenient parking near event venues, while giving locals an opportunity to earn extra income.

Dev stack
We’re using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
