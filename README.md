Overview
Weâ€™re building ParkIt, a platform to connect event-goers with nearby residents who can rent out their driveways or yards for affordable parking.

Team name
Team 0100 Loop

Idea
Provide a simple web app for users to reserve cheaper, convenient parking near event venues, while giving locals an opportunity to earn extra income.

Dev stack
Weâ€™re using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
